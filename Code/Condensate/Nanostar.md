We want the data to be formatted in the form for the Nanostar class:


(central particle of nanostar 1)
(branch1 of nanostar1)
(branch2 of nanostar1)
(branch3 of nanostar1)
(branch4 of nanostar1)
(central particle of nanostar 2)
(branch1 of nanostar2)
(branch2 of nanostar2)
(branch3 of nanostar2)
(branch4 of nanostar2)
...
(central particle of nanostar n)
(branch1 of nanostar n)
(branch2 of nanostar n)
(branch3 of nanostar n)
(branch4 of nanostar n)

where there are n nanostars with 4 branches

each branch will be a list of 3 dimensional positions of length length_of_nanostar
central particle will be a position of a single particle

Current tasks:

Simulation that sets up nanostars

Function that looks at pair list and identifies whether they are both stickers or not
