The time evolution of the active rod is given by (neglecting temperature):

$$ (x'(t),y'(t),\theta'(t)) =  v_0 \Xi^{-1}(x,y,\theta).(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta),0)$$

where $\Xi$ is the friction tensor.

We can reason about the form of this friction tensor. We know that in the limit that it is far from the boundary on either side it is a constant. It will also only have off diagonal components when we are close to the boundary layer.
